This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview
This project is made using **nextJS** as the web framework with **mongoose and mongodb** as the database. The purpose of this project creation is to learn how nextJS works and noSQL concept. 
The project feature includes :
- User Auth
- CRUD
- Test *(soon to be implemented)*

npm init
```


Then, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
